# 🛠️ Contribution Rules & Guidelines (Hacktoberfest 2025)

Welcome to this open-source repository for **React-based beginner and intermediate projects**.  
We encourage you to learn, explore, and grow through real-world practice — but please read and follow the guidelines below carefully **before contributing.**

---

## ⚙️ 1. Avoid Low-Quality or Meaningless Contributions

Hacktoberfest values **quality over quantity.**  
Low-effort contributions will be marked as *invalid* or *spam*. Avoid:

- Making random or unnecessary code edits (adding/removing lines without reason).  
- Changing colors, fonts, or minor UI elements just because of personal preference.  
- Correcting tiny grammatical errors or punctuation in README files.  
- Renaming variables or files without improving code quality.  
- Making placeholder or meaningless commits that don’t enhance the project.

> 💡 **Tip:** Every contribution should add value — fix a real issue, improve performance, structure, or add a useful feature.

---

## 🧩 2. Add Only Unique Projects

Before adding a new project, make sure it’s **not already present** in the repository.  
Duplicate or repeated ideas will be **rejected immediately.**

---

## ⚛️ 3. React-Only Projects

This repository is focused on **ReactJS-based projects only.**  
Do **not** add:

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript standalone projects  
- Backend or full-stack applications (Node, Express, etc.)  
- Projects built with other frameworks like Angular, Vue, Svelte, or Next.js  

---

## 🚀 4. Beginner & Intermediate Projects Only

This repo is meant for **learning React fundamentals.**

Allowed:
- Beginner-level projects (simple React apps demonstrating core concepts)  
- Intermediate-level projects (apps with hooks, routing, or small API usage)

Not allowed:
- Advanced or production-grade projects  

---

## 🔄 5. Keep Your Fork Updated

Before submitting a pull request (PR):

1. Sync your fork with the latest main branch.  
2. Resolve merge conflicts locally.  
3. Then push and create your PR.

This ensures a clean and conflict-free contribution.

---

## 🧱 6. Avoid Irrelevant or Redundant “Clone” Projects

Clones are allowed **only if they add learning value.**

- ✅ **Good Example:** Clone of a popular app to understand routing, props, or state management.  
- ❌ **Bad Example:** Adding another clone of a similar platform with no unique value.

> 💡 Instead of adding another clone, enhance an existing one — for example, add new features or improvements.

---

## 🚫 7. No Backend Integration

This repository is **frontend React only.**

Avoid projects that:
- Use Node.js, Express, or any backend frameworks.  
- Require databases like MongoDB, Firebase, or SQL.

Mock/static data usage is allowed.

---

## ⚠️ 8. Avoid Overly Basic Projects

Please don’t add trivial or overly simple projects like:
- Static landing pages  
- Basic counter apps  
- Dark/Light mode toggles  
- “Hello World” or button-click demos  

> This repo is not for clearing basics — it’s for applying them.

---

## 📁 9. Follow Proper Folder & Naming Structure

Each project should:

- Be in its own folder inside `/projects/`  
- Have a clear, descriptive folder name (e.g., `react-todo-app` not `my-app1`)  
- Include a short `README.md` containing:
  - Project title  
  - Description  
  - Features  
  - Steps to run locally  

---

## 🧠 10. Write Clean & Understandable Code

Ensure your code:
- Is formatted properly (use Prettier/ESLint).  
- Has meaningful comments.  
- Uses consistent naming conventions.  
- Avoids unnecessary dependencies or bloat.

---

## 🤝 11. Contribution Ethics

We promote **learning and collaboration.** By contributing, you agree to:

- Respect all contributors.  
- Avoid plagiarism — don’t copy-paste code without credit.  
- Submit only original, educational, and helpful projects.

---

## 🎉 12. Final Note

Your contribution should **help others learn React**, not just add files for Hacktoberfest.  
We value creativity, clarity, and clean code — not quantity.

Thank you for contributing and helping others grow! 🙌
